# AHKLatex
An AHK script that converts common latex commands to their equivalent Unicode.

This script is made with lyx users in mind. If you're a lyx user and encounter unexpected behaviour, please create an issue.

Running the script:
To be able to run AHKLatex.ahk, you need to install autohotkey v1.1

Running the script on startup:
Find the script file, select it, and press Ctrl+C.
Press Win+R to open the Run dialog, then enter shell:startup and click OK or Enter. This will open the Startup folder for the current user. To instead open the folder for all users, enter shell:common startup (however, in that case you must be an administrator to proceed).
Right click inside the window, and click "Paste Shortcut". The shortcut to the script should now be in the Startup folder.

Editing the script:
It is recommended to edit this file with UltraEdit/pycharm. Other editors might not support some of the unicode here, and have not been tested.
